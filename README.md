# Project Euler

This is a collection of problems (and attempted solutions) at various problems from
the [Project Euler](http://projecteuler.net).  I will (hopefully) add entries in 
the Makefile to run basic unit tests against the attempted code and also to run the 
actual code.  A lot of the format will be figured out eventually.

This started from a hack night where we were to compete to see which team could 
solve the most problems (based on problem # for value).  Go "Ferris Euler's Day 
Off"!
